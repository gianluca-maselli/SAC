# SAC (Soft Actor-Critic)
The repository contains the PyTorch implementation of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) described in ["Soft Actor-Critic: Off-Policy Maximum Entropy Deep Reinforcement Learning with a Stochastic Actor"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.01290).

This implementation of the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm has been updated to support modern libraries and environments. It is compatible with Gymnasium and works with the DeepMind Control Suite.
